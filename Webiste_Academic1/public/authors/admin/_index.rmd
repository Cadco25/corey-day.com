Hello! My name is Corey, and this is my website. It is very much a work-in-progress! My goal for this site is to create a space where I can share my research in a digestible format. I also hope to write some blog posts about my experiences in science, and honestly, to build an avenue for some self-advertisement. My work focuses on vector-borne disease ecology and epidemiology -- you can learn more about me and my research by scrolling down to the About Me section of this page. I am slowly adding a short summary of my ongoing projects to the "Projects" page, which I will amend with any related publications whenever those come out. Of course, if you want to reach out, you can find my twitter and LinkedIn pages underneath that big picture of my face :)
