[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rHello! My name is Corey, and this is my website. My primary motivation for building this site is to create a space where I can share reader-friendly versions of my scientific work. Peer-reviewed scientific literature is often impenetrable for everyone except the select few who work in that field of study (which is not news). These days, I am working on some projects that have real, practical relevance to people around me. If my research can be useful for people who want to protect themselves and their families from a disease, then I feel that those people have a right to access and understand that research. Peer-reviewed publications do not empower people in that way. On this site, I will produce reader-friendly versions of my published research products that are light on jargon and emphasize the main points of the work.\nA secondary goal for this website is to host tutorials for some of my workflows. Mostly, this will be limited to R tutorials, but I may also write some short guides for other work that I do (e.g., mosquito collection protocols). The internet is full of great resources for learning (especially when it comes to R), but I still come across the occasional task that is not well-documented online. I have benefited greatly from the unpaid work of others who produce learning resources online, so I want to pay it forward.\n","date":1372636800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1372636800,"objectID":"d33c1cd8bead9ce2a6229ddb7fdca4a5","permalink":"https://www.Corey-Day.com/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"Hello!

The La Crosse virus vectors: Aedes triseriatus, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes japonicus (all photos taken from BugGuide.net)\n\rHave you heard of La Crosse virus?\rSince 2016, I have either been studying or conducting research on some element of the La Crosse virus disease system, and frankly, that fact has been somewhat isolating for me. Even within the world of mosquito-borne disease researchers, few people actively study La Crosse virus. Outside of that world, I have met extremely few people who had ever heard of La Crosse virus at all. That fact is disconcerting to me, because I have spent my entire life residing in Appalachia, where more people are infected with La Crosse virus than anywhere else in the world. Every summer, children in Appalachia will develop a mysterious flu-likely illness that quickly begins to cause seizures, and possibly even comas. Some of those children will develop neurological disabilities that hinder them for years. For most of those children and their parents, their diagnosis will be the first time they learn about La Crosse virus.\nMy goal for this post is to produce a reader-friendly description of La Crosse virus disease (i.e., La Crosse encephalitis). Everything I write will be based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence, although I will not provide a full references list as I would in a scientific manuscript. I encourage interested parties to also visit the CDC’s official website.\n\rThe impact of La Crosse virus disease\rLa Crosse virus (LACV) is transmitted by mosquitoes, and it is the second-most common cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. Most of the time, when a human is exposed to LACV, they will never know that it happened. Sometimes (we really don’t know how often), a LACV infection causes a generic, flu-like illness that will probably never be diagnosed. Less often (but probably more often than reported), LACV infects the central nervous system, causing neuroinvasive disease. Neuroinvasive LACV disease usually occurs in children, and LACV causes more pediatric neuroinvasive disease than any other mosquito-borne virus in the US. Neuroinvasive LACV infections are usually called La Crosse encephalitis (LACE), because the infection regularly causes encephalitis (i.e., inflammation of the brain). However, neuroinvasive LACV infections may instead result in meningitis (infection of membranes surrounding the brain) or meningoencephalitis (a combination of encephalitis and meningitis) [1].\nMore than 90% of all neuroinvasive LACV disease occurs in children aged 18 years and younger. This is thought to be because young individuals have reduced capacities to prevent LACV infection from reaching the nervous system. Regardless of age, LACV infections are rarely fatal (fewer than 1% of reported infections lead to death). However, the illness can be severe in other ways. Neuroinvasive LACV disease often requires hospitalization, likely in a specialized pediatric hospital. There is no defined treatment for LACV disease, so medical professionals can only provide supportive treatments. The financial costs of treatment, time taken off work for parents, and travel to and from hospitals can be extreme. Worse, because many cases of severe LACV disease cause lifelong neurological disabilities, there are additional costs associated with the disease even after the primary treatment has ended. A study from 2003 found that the total cost of neuroinvasive LACV disease for children who have lifelong consequences could exceed $3 million [2].\n\rWhere is the risk?\rFig 2.  Map of neuroinvasive La Crosse virus disease cases in the eastern United States from 2003 to 2021 (data from ArboNET; map author: Corey Day)\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, LACV disease is rare. For the entire United States, fewer than 100 cases of LACV disease are diagnosed each year. That statistic misses the bigger (or smaller?) picture; LACV infection risk depends heavily on where one lives. Almost every case of LACV disease is associated with a few high-risk areas in either Appalachia or the upper Midwest. Often, when someone is diagnosed with the disease outside of those areas, they recently traveled to one of the high-risk regions before becoming ill. Consistently, LACV disease occurs in the same regions in a select number of counties. The highest risks by-far are for children living in western North Carolina, east Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio. In 2018, researchers in North Carolina realized that not only does LACV disease consistently occur in the same counties, but it also occurs at the same households. In some cases, this meant that multiple children living at one house became sick during the same year. Surprisingly, they also found that people were also becoming sick at the same household in different years. The most extreme example of this was two cases of LACV disease that occurred 7 years apart, with ownership of the home being transferred during that 7-year period [3].\n\rWhat is being done …","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654193783,"objectID":"7603cf48a71a999082e97642570d7a2d","permalink":"https://www.Corey-Day.com/post/what-is-la-crosse-virus-disease/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-is-la-crosse-virus-disease/","section":"post","summary":"A brief overview of La Crosse virus disease.","tags":["VBD","La Crosse virus disease","Mosquitoes"],"title":"What is La Crosse Virus Disease?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","spatial epi"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1653264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653354170,"objectID":"5a131829f2a5f3bc16f618849d4c23a5","permalink":"https://www.Corey-Day.com/project/geographic-epidemiology/how-to-use-rflexscan-for-tango-s-flexibly-shaped-scan-statistic/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/geographic-epidemiology/how-to-use-rflexscan-for-tango-s-flexibly-shaped-scan-statistic/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["R","rflexscan","spatial epi"],"title":"How to use rflexscan for Tango's Flexibly Shaped Scan Statistic ","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
