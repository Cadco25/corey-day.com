Prior to my research, there was some evidence that La Crosse virus risk was spatially persistent, meaning that if there is high risk at one location right now, that location will continue to have high risk in the future. If that pattern of spatial persistence is true, then it will be important for future efforts to prevent La Crosse virus infections. Hopefully, we can use the results of this research to find the places where people are most likely to become infected so that we can prevent more children from getting sick.\nThere is a need for formal epidemiological analyses using spatial tools to investigate the spatial patterns of La Crosse virus disease. My hypothesis is that the geographic distribution of La Crosse virus disease has remained consistent in the last two decades. To test that hypothesis, I am conducting high-risk disease cluster analyses on multiple geographic scales. First, I am using publicly available data from the United States’ arboviral disease database, ArboNET, to investigate disease clustering at the county level in the eastern United States. A county-level disease cluster is a group of neighboring counties that have significantly higher La Crosse virus disease risk than the eastern United States overall. Prior to my work, only one study has investigated La Crosse virus disease clustering at this scale, using data from 2003 to 2007. I repeated the analysis for that time period and additionally investigating clustering in subsequent time periods to compare the distribution of high-risk clusters from 2003 to 2021. This research is currently under peer review, and I will update this page with a link to the open access article once it is published. For now, here is a hint: disease risk has remained persistent in a few clusters of counties for nearly 20 years.\nI will also conduct a fine-scale investigation of risk clustering in partnership with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. North Carolina has some of the highest rates of La Crosse virus disease in the country, and the vast majority of that disease is reported from a few counties in western NC. Whilst ensuring that the privacy of individuals is protected, I will conduct a household-level cluster investigation using the home addresses of all reported La Crosse virus disease in North Carolina from 1997 to 2020. My hypothesis is that the addresses will not be randomly distributed throughout the high-risk counties, but instead that the houses are often clustered together. If that is true, then this work will identify specific areas where people consistently become infected with La Crosse virus, and public health officials can target their prevention efforts directly to those places. This might include virus surveillance, mosquito control, and awareness campaigns to help people protect their children from La Crosse virus disease.\n","date":1667692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667758291,"objectID":"87b801a65753c795012bf7d284b9f653","permalink":"https://www.Corey-Day.com/project/spatial-temporal-clusters-of-la-crosse-virus-disease/","publishdate":"2022-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/spatial-temporal-clusters-of-la-crosse-virus-disease/","section":"project","summary":"Part of my PhD research focuses on the geographic epidemiology of La Crosse virus disease, which is a mosquito borne disease that primarily affects children.

The most common is Kulldorf’s circular scan statistic (used with SatScan software), which identifies circularly-shaped clusters. A lesser-known but powerful scan statistic is Tango’s flexibly-shaped scan statistic (FSSS), which identifies “flexibly-shaped” clusters. This simply means that instead of only identifying clusters in a circular form, the flexible scan statistic can identify clusters of any shape. This is useful in the myriad scenarios where clusters are not likely to literally form a circle.\nThe most straight-forward way to use Tango’s FSSS is with the freely-available FlexScan software, which works similarly to SatScan. FlexScan works well, but as with most click-based software, using it for large workloads becomes cumbersome, and issues with replication may arise. Queue rflexscan, the R package that implements Tango’s FSSS. This package can do everything that FlexScan does, with the benefit of reproducible R code that can be converted into functions and loops for large projects. Additionally, by working in R, you have access to the plethora of R packages for spatial analysis, allowing you to complete most (or all) of your workflow in a single environment.\nThe downside to rflexscan is that it is not well-documented online. The user manual is a good starting point, but is probably not enough to get inexperienced users going. Because the FSSS is not so commonly used, rflexscan also seems to lack user-made tutorials that are so helpful for other R packages. With that issue in mind, I am creating this tutorial that will help people use rflexscan to detect flexibly-shaped disease clusters. I will walk through an example from beginning-to-end, relying entirely on R and its helpful packages to create a reproducible workflow. I hope that this will help the next person who wants to use this package!\nAssumptions\rI am going to assume basic R knowledge, including knowledge of the tidyverse family of packages for data manipulation. If you struggle to understand any data manipulation in this article, I highly recommend visting Our Coding Club and working through their data manipulation tutorials. The skills gained from those tutorials can drastically improve your efficiency when working with data.\n\rInstalling the necessary packages\rI am going to rely on a few different packages for this tutorial: rflexscan, spdep, sf, and tidyverse. Each of these packages are excellent for spatial analysis, so installing them should be worthwhile for you. If you have not installed them, use install.packages(\u0026#39;insert_package_name_here\u0026#39;).

The La Crosse virus vectors: Aedes triseriatus, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes japonicus (photos from BugGuide.net)\n\rHave you heard of La Crosse virus?\rEven within the world of mosquito-borne disease researchers, few people actively study La Crosse virus. Outside of that world, I have met extremely few people who had ever heard of La Crosse virus at all. That fact is disconcerting to me, because I have spent my entire life residing in Appalachia, where more people are infected with La Crosse virus than anywhere else in the world. Every summer, children in Appalachia will develop a mysterious flu-likely illness that quickly begins to cause seizures, and possibly even comas. Some of those children will develop neurological disabilities that hinder them for years. For most of those children and their parents, their diagnosis will be the first time they learn about La Crosse virus.\nMy goal for this post is to produce a short, reader-friendly description of La Crosse virus disease (often called La Crosse encephalitis). Everything I write will be based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence, although I will not provide a full references list as I would in a scientific manuscript. I encourage interested parties to also visit the CDC’s official website.\n\rThe impact of La Crosse virus disease\rLa Crosse virus (LACV) is transmitted by mosquitoes and it is the second-most common cause of mosquito-borne disease in the United States. Most of the time, when a human is exposed to LACV, they will never know that it happened. Sometimes (we really don’t know how often), a LACV infection causes a generic, flu-like illness that will probably never be diagnosed. Less often (but more often than reported), LACV infects the central nervous system, causing neuroinvasive disease. More than 90% of all LACV disease occurs in children aged 18 years and younger. This is thought to be because young individuals have reduced capacities to prevent LACV infection from reaching the nervous system. Regardless of age, LACV infections are rarely fatal, but often have severe long-term effects. Neuroinvasive LACV infections are usually called La Crosse encephalitis (LACE), because the infection regularly causes encephalitis (i.e., inflammation of the brain). However, neuroinvasive LACV infections may instead result in meningitis (infection of membranes surrounding the brain) or meningoencephalitis (a combination of encephalitis and meningitis) [see 1 for research on the health effects of LACV disease on children]. Symptoms of LACV infection initially include headaches, vomiting, and fatigue, and severe neuroinvasive cases often lead to seizures. Severe cases can also cause chronic seizure disorders, partial paralysis of the body, and lifelong cognitive disabilities.\nNeuroinvasive LACV disease often requires hospitalization, likely in a specialized pediatric hospital. There is no defined treatment for LACV disease, so medical professionals can only provide supportive treatments. The financial costs of treatment, time taken off work for parents, and travel to and from hospitals can be extreme. Worse, because many cases of severe LACV disease cause lifelong neurological disabilities, there are additional costs associated with the disease even after the primary treatment has ended. A study from 2003 found that the total cost of neuroinvasive LACV disease for children who have lifelong consequences could exceed $3 million [see 2 for research on economic impacts of LACV disease in North Carolina]. Few families are prepared for this type of financial burden, especially in the economically disadvantaged Appalachian region, where most LACV disease occurrs.\n\rWhere is the risk?\rFig 2.  Map of neuroinvasive La Crosse virus disease cases in the eastern United States from 2003 to 2021 (data from ArboNET; map author: Corey Day)\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, LACV disease is rare. For the entire United States, fewer than 100 cases of LACV disease are diagnosed each year, but that statistic misses the bigger (or smaller?) picture: a small group of people bear most of the burden of LACV diseases. LACV infection risk depends heavily on where one lives, and almost every case of LACV disease is associated with a few high-risk areas in either Appalachia or the upper Midwest. Consistently, LACV disease occurs in the same regions in a select number of counties. The highest risks by-far are for children living in western North Carolina, east Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio (see Fig. 2 for the case distribution of LACV disease from 2003 to 2021). In 2018, researchers in North Carolina realized that not only does LACV disease consistently occur in the same counties, but it also occurs at the same households. In some cases, this meant that multiple children living at one house became sick during the same year. Surprisingly, they also found that people were also becoming sick at the same household in different years. The most extreme example of this was two cases of …","date":1654128000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654193783,"objectID":"04fb76528a70c4cefbab0bc6fa5f3dee","permalink":"https://www.Corey-Day.com/research-posts/what-is-la-crosse-virus-disease/","publishdate":"2022-06-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-posts/what-is-la-crosse-virus-disease/","section":"research posts","summary":"A brief overview of La Crosse virus disease.","tags":["VBD","La Crosse virus disease","Mosquitoes"],"title":"What is La Crosse Virus Disease?","type":"research posts"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
