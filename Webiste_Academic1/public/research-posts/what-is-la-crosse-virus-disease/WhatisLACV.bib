  abstract = {BACKGROUND La Crosse encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease that can be mistaken for herpes simplex encephalitis. It has been reported in 28 states but may be underrecognized. METHODS We investigated the manifestations and clinical course of La Crosse encephalitis in 127 patients hospitalized from 1987 through 1996. The diagnosis was established by serologic testing for IgM and IgG antibodies to La Crosse virus. Data were collected by chart review. RESULTS Most of the patients were school-aged children (mean [+/-SD] age, 7.8+/-3.5 years; range, 0.5 to 15.0). Symptoms included headache, fever, and vomiting (each in 70 percent or more of the patients), seizures (in 46 percent), and disorientation (in 42 percent). Thirteen percent had aseptic meningitis. Hyponatremia developed in 21 percent, and there were signs of increased intracranial pressure in 13 percent. Six patients, including three with cerebral herniation, underwent intracranial-pressure monitoring. The 13 patients (11 percent) whose condition deteriorated in the hospital had decreases in serum sodium levels (P=0.007), and increases in body temperature (P=0.003) at the time of deterioration. At admission, these patients more often had a history of vomiting (P=0.047) and a score of 12 or lower on the Glasgow Coma Scale (P=0.02) than the others; a trend toward a greater prevalence of seizures at admission was also evident in this group (P=0.07). All the patients survived, but 15 of them (12 percent) had neurologic deficits at discharge. Follow-up assessments, performed in 28 children, suggested an increase in cognitive and behavioral deficits 10 to 18 months after the episode of encephalitis. CONCLUSIONS La Crosse virus infection should be considered in children who present with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis. Hyponatremia and increasing body temperature may be related to clinical deterioration.},

  abstract = {The fields of entomology, geospatial science, and science communication are understaffed in many areas, resulting in poor community awareness and heightened risks of vector-borne diseases. This is especially true in East Tennessee, where La Crosse encephalitis (LACE) causes pediatric illness each year. In response to these problems, we created a community engagement program that includes a yearlong academy for secondary STEM educators in the 6–12 grade classroom. The objectives of this program were to support inquiry-driven classroom learning to foster student interest in STEM fields, produce community-driven mosquito surveillance, and enhance community awareness of LACE. We trained educators in medical entomology, geospatial science, and science communication, and they incorporated those skills into lesson plans for a mosquito oviposition experiment that tested hypotheses developed in the classroom. Here, we share results from the first two years of the MEGA:BITESS academy, tailored for our community by having students ask questions directly related to Aedes mosquito oviposition biology and La Crosse encephalitis. In year one, we recruited 17 educators to participate in the project, and 15 of those educators returned in year two. All participating educators completed the academy, conducted the oviposition experiment, and informed over 400 students about a variety of careers and disciplines for their students. Here, we present a community-based program that helps to address the problems associated with long-term mosquito surveillance, health and science education and communication, career opportunities, and the community needs of Appalachia, as well as the initial data on the effectiveness of two years of an educator-targeted professional-development program.},

  abstract = {La Crosse encephalitis (LACE), a human illness caused by a mosquito-transmitted virus, is endemic in western North Carolina. To assess the economic and social impacts of the illness, 25 serologically confirmed LACE case patients and/or families were interviewed to obtain information on the economic costs and social burden of the disease. The total direct and indirect medical costs associated with LACE over 89.6 life years accumulated from the onset of illness to the date of interview for 24 patients with frank encephalitis totaled \$791,374 (range \$7,521−175,586), with a mean ± SD per patient cost of \$32,974 ± \$34,793. The projected cost of a case with lifelong neurologic sequelae ranged from \$48,775 to \$3,090,798 (n 5). For the 25 LACE patients, 55.15 (54.83\%) of the 100.59 cumulative life years (CLYs) were impaired to some degree. Disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated to measure the productive life years lost to LACE. Approximately 13.00 DALYs were accumulated over 100.59 CLYs of study. Projected DALYs for case patients (n 5) with lifelong neurologic sequelae ranged from 12.90 to 72.37 DALYs. An Impact of La Crosse Encephalitis Survey (ILCES) was used to measure the social impact of LACE over time for case patients and their families. The ILCES scores demonstrated that the majority of the social burden of the illness is borne by the five patients with lifelong neurologic sequelae. The socioeconomic burden resulting from LACE is substantial, which highlights the importance of the illness in western North Carolina, as well as the need for active surveillance, reporting, and prevention programs for the infection.},
