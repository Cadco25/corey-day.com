<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville, where I work as a graduate research assistant in <a href="https://epp.tennessee.edu/directory/dr-rebecca-trout-fryxell/">Dr. Becky Trout Fryxell’s</a> Medical &amp; Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. I have been actively doing some kind of mosquito-related science since I joined <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/bdbyrd.aspx">Dr. Brian Byrd’s</a> Mosquito and Vector-Borne Infectious Disease lab as an undergraduate student in 2016. I received by Bachelor of Science degree in environmental health science (a branch of public health) from Western Carolina University in 2018. I remained in Dr. Byrd’s lab to complete a Master of Science in biology, with research focusing on the ecology of native and invasive mosquitoes that inhabit riverine rock pools. While pursuing my master’s degree, I also had the opportunity to participate in CDC-funded research in the United States Virgin Islands, where I helped characterize the mosquito species on the island and investigate household cisterns as cryptic habitats of <em>Aedes aegypti</em>. I received my M.S. in 2020, and moved to Knoxville, TN in that same year to pursue my PhD in entomology and plant pathology from the University of Tennessee - Knoxville.</p>
<p>My PhD research is focused on the mosquito-borne La Crosse virus, which causes neuroinvasive disease in children, mostly in the Appalachian region of the United States. My objectives are to: (1) identify environmental variables associated with the spatial and temporal distribution of La Crosse virus disease in southern Appalachia; (2) investigate the population structure and dispersal patterns of La Crosse virus vectors; (3) investigate how urbanization effects mosquito community compositions in southern Appalachia; (4) highlight the potential for mosquito traps to produce biased our understanding of mosquito community composition at sites of La Crosse virus transmission.</p>
<p>When I am not working, I do have other interests! My favorite activities currently include ultimate frisbee,disc golf, watching and discussing movies, playing online chess, having beers with my wife and friends, and spending time with my wife and pets.</p>
