<p>My motivation for building this website is to create a space where I can conveniently share reader-friendly versions of my work. Peer-reviewed scientific literature is often impenetrable for everyone except the select few who work in that field of study, which is not news to anyone. Until now, the fact that my family and friends are unable to read and understand my published work has not seemed like a big deal to me, because that work was so niche that there is no reason that a regular person should need to know it. These days, I am working on projects that have real, practical relevance to people around me, including work that highlights vector-borne disease risk in the region I call home. If my research can be useful for people who want to protect themselves and their families from a disease, then I feel that those people have a right to access and understand that research. Peer-reviewed publications do not empower people in that way. On this site, I will produce reader-friendly versions of my published research products that are light on jargon and emphasize the main points of the work.</p>
<p>A secondary goal for this website is to host tutorials for some of my workflows. Mostly, this will be limited to R tutorials, but I may also write some short guides for other work that I do (e.g., mosquito collection protocols). The internet is full of great resources for learning (especially when it comes to R), but I still come across the occasional task that is not well-documented online. I have benefited greatly from the unpaid work of others who produce learning resources online, so I want to pay it forward.</p>
