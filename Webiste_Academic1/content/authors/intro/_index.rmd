I am a PhD student at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. I work as a graduate research assistant in [Dr. Becky Trout Fryxell's](https://epp.tennessee.edu/directory/dr-rebecca-trout-fryxell/) Medical & Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. My research is focused on the mosquito-borne La Crosse virus, which causes neuroinvasive disease in children, mostly in the Appalachian region of the United States. My research objectives are to: (1) identify environmental variables associated with  the spatial and temporal distribution of La Crosse virus disease in southern Appalachia; (2) investigate the population structure and dispersal patterns of La Crosse virus vectors; (3) investigate how urbanization effects mosquito community compositions in southern Appalachia; (4) highlight the potential for mosquito traps to produce biased our understanding of mosquito community composition at sites of La Crosse virus transmission.   

I have been actively doing some kind of mosquito-related science since I joined Dr. Brian Byrd's [Mosquito and Vector-Borne Infectious Disease](https://www.wcu.edu/learn/departments-schools-colleges/HHS/healthsci/mosquito-vector-borne-infectious-disease-facility/index.aspx) lab as an undergraduate student in 2016. Although I have focused on mosquito-borne disease, I have broader public health interests, particularly in disease systems that cross the boundary of humans and wildlife (i.e., One Health problems). At the techincal level, I also have strong interests in working with all sorts of data. I mostly use R for data science, and I am currently interested in using R for spatial data analysis to conduct geographic epidemiological studies. 

If I am not working, I do have other interests! Some of my currently preferred activies are playing ultimate frisbee and disc golf, [reviewing movies](https://letterboxd.com/Cadco/), playing online chess, and doing just about anything with my wife and animals.
