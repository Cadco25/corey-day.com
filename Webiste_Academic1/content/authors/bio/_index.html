<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville where I work as a graduate research assistant in <a href="https://epp.tennessee.edu/directory/dr-rebecca-trout-fryxell/">Dr. Becky Trout Fryxell’s</a> Medical &amp; Veterinary Entomology Laboratory. My research is focused on the mosquito-borne La Crosse virus, which causes neuroinvasive disease in children, mostly in the Appalachian region of the United States. My research objectives are to: (1) identify environmental variables associated with the spatial and temporal distribution of La Crosse virus disease in southern Appalachia; (2) investigate the population structure and dispersal patterns of La Crosse virus vectors; (3) investigate how urbanization effects mosquito community compositions in southern Appalachia; (4) highlight the potential for mosquito traps to produce biased our understanding of mosquito community composition at sites of La Crosse virus transmission.</p>
<p>I have been doing some kind of mosquito-related research since I joined <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/bdbyrd.aspx">Dr. Brian Byrd’s</a> Mosquito and Vector-Borne Infectious Disease lab as an undergraduate student in 2016. Although I have focused on mosquito-borne disease, I have broader public health interests, particularly in disease systems that cross the boundary of humans and wildlife (i.e., One Health problems). At the technical level, I also have strong interests in working with all sorts of data. I mostly use R for data science, and I am currently interested in using R for spatial data analysis to conduct geographic epidemiological studies.</p>
<p>If I am not working, I do have other interests! My current favorite activities are ultimate frisbee, disc golf, movies, online chess, hanging with my grad school pals, and doing just about anything to spend time with my wife and animals.</p>
