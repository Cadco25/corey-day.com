<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Scan statistics are commonly used in epidemiology for detecting geographic clusters of disease. The most common is Kulldorf’s circular scan statistic (used with SatScan software), which identifies circularly-shaped clusters. A lesser-known but powerful scan statistic is Tango’s flexibly-shaped scan statistic (FSSS), which identifies “flexibly-shaped” clusters. This simply means that instead of only identifying clusters in a circular form, the flexible scan statistic can identify clusters of any shape. This is useful in the myriad scenarios where clusters are not likely to literally form a circle.</p>
<p>The most straight-forward way to use Tango’s FSSS is with the freely-available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/flexscansoftware/download_e">FlexScan software</a>, which works similarly to SatScan. FlexScan works well, but as with most click-based software, using it for large workloads becomes cumbersome, and issues with replication may arise. Queue <code>rflexscan</code>, the R package that implements Tango’s FSSS. This package can do everything that FlexScan does, with the benefit of reproducible R code that can be converted into functions and loops for large projects. Additionally, by working in R, you have access to the plethora of R packages for spatial analysis, allowing you to complete most (or all) of your workflow in a single environment.</p>
<p>The downside to <code>rflexscan</code> is that it is not well-documented online. <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rflexscan/rflexscan.pdf">The user manual</a> is a good starting point, but is probably not enough to get inexperienced users going. Because the FSSS is not so commonly used, <code>rflexscan</code> also seems to lack user-made tutorials that are so helpful for other R packages. With that issue in mind, I am creating this tutorial that will help people use <code>rflexscan</code> to detect flexibly-shaped disease clusters. I will walk through an example from beginning-to-end, relying entirely on R and its helpful packages to create a reproducible workflow. I hope that this will help the next person who wants to use this package!</p>
<div id="assumptions" class="section level2">
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<p>I am going to assume basic R knowledge, including knowledge of the <code>tidyverse</code> family of packages for data manipulation. If you struggle to understand any data manipulation in this article, I highly recommend visting <a href="https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials.html">Our Coding Club</a> and working through their data manipulation tutorials. The skills gained from those tutorials can drastically improve your efficiency when working with data.</p>

<div id="installing-the-necessary-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing the necessary packages</h2>
<p>I am going to rely on a few different packages for this tutorial: <code>rflexscan</code>, <code>spdep</code>, <code>sf</code>, and <code>tidyverse</code>. Each of these packages are excellent for spatial analysis, so installing them should be worthwhile for you. If you have not installed them, use <code>install.packages('insert_package_name_here')</code>. Once they are installed, use the code below to load them.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rflexscan)
library(spdep)
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
